Google Passport Example
========================

This app is a building block for using Google OAuth 2.0. 

## Getting set up
You will need to create a project on Google Cloud Services, and enable this project to 
do OAuth 2.0 login.  As part of this process you will:

Give Google the URLs of this app, and of an intermediate route which it will use in the login process

Get a client ID and secret (these are like the API keys), and add them in the `.env` file. 

See the [detailed instructions](https://web.cs.ucdavis.edu/~amenta/s20/oauthClientID.html)
